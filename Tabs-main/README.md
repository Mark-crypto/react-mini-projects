## Tabs displaying jobs and their respective details
- The project is done in React JS and the main hooks in use are useEffect and useState.

- useEffect is used to access a link from an API where we access our data.
- Noticably we use a third party package called UUID. The package simply provides us unique IDs to use for our project.
